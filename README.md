# Finally fluid playback on Bluetooth headphones!

It fixes the issue with Bluetooth headphones like the Sony wh-1000xm2,
where it delays and buffers every time you pause and resume playback.
It does this by keeping the connection active with an unhearable 0hz sound.

Fluid playback, as long as the program runs.
